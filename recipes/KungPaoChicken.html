        <h3><em>The classic peanuts in Kung Pao chicken recipe are replaced with cashews, and additional vegetables provide extra balance. No regrets the day afterâ€”just the spicy Kung Pao goodness you've been craving.</em></h3>
        <p>Because kung pao chicken is so well-liked in the United States, one might be tempted to think of it as a Chinese-American dish. However, this fiery stir-fried chicken is a traditional Sichuan dish.</p>
        <p>Although there are many different ways to prepare it, this dish has been around since the late 1800s. Fundamentally, Kung Pao chicken is just a straightforward dish made of chopped up chicken breasts stir-fried in "Kung Pao sauce," which is mainly made up of vinegar, soy sauce, and a small amount of sugar.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>Soy sauce (or tamari)</li>
            <li>Vinegar (rice vinegar or sherry vinegar)</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Toasted sesame and vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Red & green bell peppers</li>
            <li>Green onions</li>
            <li>Cashews</li>

            <li>Fresh garlic & ginger</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps to make the Kung Pao Chicken</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Kung Pao sauce: To make the Kung Pao sauce, combine the vinegar, sugar, and soy sauce in a bowl. </li>
            <li>Prep the chicken: Slice the skinless, boneless chicken breast into even strips using a sharp knife. If your chicken is a little frozen, this will be a little simpler to accomplish. After that, coat it with a little soy sauce and cornstarch.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken until crispy: Work in batches to avoid packing the pan and stir-fry the chicken pieces in sesame oil until they are cooked through and beautifully crispy, using a large, heavy skillet or a wok if you have one.</li>
            <li>Stir-Fry: Add the bell peppers and stir-fry until they start to soften. Next, incorporate the dried chili peppers, cashews, ginger, garlic, and scallions. After a minute or two of stir-frying, add the cooked chicken and Kung Pao sauce.</li>
            <li>Simmer: Give the flavors several more minutes to combine over the heat. You want the Kung Pao sauce to coat the chicken and vegetables thoroughly, so it will thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Serve!: Serve this with hot bowls of brown rice or white rice.</li>
        </ol>
