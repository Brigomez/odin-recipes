        <h1>Tres Golpes(Three Strikes)</h1>
        <img src="/images/tresgolpes.webp">
        <h3><em>The most emblematic breakfast in the Dominican Republic is Tres Golpes. It is made up of three simple, delectable, and highly protein-rich ingredients: fried cheese, salami, and eggs. Their flavors and textures go well together. Mangú (mashed green bananas), is typically served with them because it is a crucial component of Dominican flavors.</em></h3>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups canola oil, divided</li>
            <li>12 slices of Tropical Fried Cheese</li>
            <li>8 slices of Special Tropical Salami</li>
            <li>6 fried eggs, to serve</li>
            <li>1 avocado, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mangu</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 bananas (green, unripe)</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, sliced</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pickled onions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 red onion cut into rings</li>
            <li>1 cup of vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (or more, to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the onion rings to a medium-sized bowl along with a dash of vinegar and salt. Allow it to soak for about an hour while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Peel the bananas and cut them into quarters. Place the bananas in a large pot with enough water to cover them by 1 inch (2cm). Add salt to taste. Bring the plantains to a boil over high heat and cook until very tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Concurrently, raise the temperature of canola oil in a medium skillet to 350°F on high.</li>
            <li>Slices of Tropical Frying Cheese should be fried for approximately three minutes, or until golden brown on both sides, in 1 1/4 cups of canola oil. Take out of the pan and place on a paper-towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Fry the salami for 4 minutes, or until it turns golden and crispy on both sides, using an additional tablespoon of oil in the pan. Take out of the pan and place on a paper towel-lined plate as well.</li>
            <li>After cleaning the pan, add one more tablespoon of oil. Add the onions along with the liquid they soaked in. After about ten minutes of sautéing, the onions should be soft and bright pink.</li>
            <li>When the bananas are soft, take them out of the water and put them in a big bowl of their own. Meanwhile, continue boiling the same water on the stove.</li>
            <li>Stir in the butter and about 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot banana-starch liquid. Once cooked, mash the bananas until smooth and creamy. As needed, add additional liquid.</li>
            <li>Along with the fried cheese, fried salami, fried eggs, and avocado, serve the mangú. Add pickled onions as garnish.</li>
        </ol>
