            <li>Mustard powder</li>
            <li>Dried basil</li>
            <li>White pepper</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Step 1: Buttermilk brine</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the beaten egg and buttermilk.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken pieces, salt, pepper, and paprika in a big bowl.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is thoroughly coated, pour the buttermilk and egg mixture over the top and stir.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in the refrigerator, cover it, and let it soak up the buttermilk brine for the entire night.</li>
        </ol>    
        <h3>Step 2: Coat the chicken </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, cornflour, spices, and herbs.</li>
            <li>One by one, coat each chicken piece in the dry flour mixture. Before coating, gently shake off any excess buttermilk from the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 3: Fry the chicken</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To avoid packing the pan too full, fry the chicken pieces three to four at a time in the heated oil. Cook the chicken until it is cooked through in the center and has a golden brown color on all sides.</li>
            <li>While you finish cooking the other batches, place the finished chicken pieces on a wire rack resting over an oven tray and keep warm in the oven.</li>
        </ol>
